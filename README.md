# Dungeon-Master-Assistant
 A google docs add-on to assist in the more technical aspects of writing quests for DnD.

 Current major features include creation of custom monsters/NPCs, and random generation of loot from the DMG. Custom items can be stored as well (but will not be added to the loot tables).

 At the current moment the project is "finished". I most likely won't upload anymore of my own features. If you have your own ideas, feel free to submit a pull request or fork for your own personal use.

 Happy DMing!
